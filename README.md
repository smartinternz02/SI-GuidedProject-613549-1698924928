# Image-caption-generator
The purpose of this project is to develop an image caption generator using Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to model sequential data. The model takes an input image and generates a descriptive caption that conveys the visual information present in the image. By combining the power of deep learning with natural language processing, we aim to bridge the gap between images and textual descriptions, enabling machines to comprehend and communicate the content of visual data.
